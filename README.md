# What this is
Some fun tools that I've made as a sort of Business card for future business, and a showcase for things Ive worked on in the past that I didnt quite feel right deleting. 

## What's all here
- lots and lots of webedits 
- Some random number manipulation tools and generation
- An F1 racing timer minigame (kind of cursed, but I thought it was cool)
- POC for Conway's game of life that autoruns in the background
  - The cool thing about this is it is lacing the state of the game into the Random Number gen happening throughout the site! This is something I'm passionate about as I personally believe Emergence is the missing key in many oustanding problems that plague the CS field.
- Some super meased up NIST tools, but again, I love them because they're not perfect.
